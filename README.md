# KeyAuth-CSHARP-OnGUI-Login


This is a login example for a UnityEngine OnGUI like a BepInEx mod cheat or whatever I made this for Gorilla Tag.

If you need help just do a issue report, and use a injector **SharpMonoInjector** to inject it or use the injector / Loader class for your own loader.

**Or just add "BepInPlugin[("developer.heo.example", "Example UI", "1.0.0")] and the MonoBehaviour to "BaseUnityPlugin", just remove the " characters, for BepInEx.**
